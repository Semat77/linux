Scripts
This repository contains a collection of shell scripts that I have written. These scripts are developed purely for personal enjoyment and exploration of shell scripting.

Description
The "Linux" project is a compilation of various scripts written in shell. These scripts serve different purposes and are intended to showcase my personal exploration and experimentation with shell scripting.

Note: These scripts are developed as a hobby and may not adhere to industry best practices or security standards. Use them at your own risk.
